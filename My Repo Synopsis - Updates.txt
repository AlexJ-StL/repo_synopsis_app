My Repo Synopsis - Updates

Traverse directory
1. Implement logging instead of print statements for better error tracking and debugging.
2. Add a timeout mechanism for model loading to prevent long waits during processing.
3. Use a retry mechanism for transient errors when loading or processing the model to improve resilience.

generate directory tree
1. Add a parameter to control whether to include hidden files in the directory traversal.  
2. Implement a logging mechanism instead of using print statements for error handling.  
3. Consider using `pathlib` for more modern and readable path manipulations.  

get file language
1. Add an option to customize the indentation character for better readability (e.g., spaces vs. tabs).
2. Include file size and modification date in the output for more informative directory listings.
3. Implement a depth limit parameter to control how deep the directory tree should be displayed.

handle directory error
1. Add an optional parameter to control the depth of the directory traversal, allowing users to limit how deep the tree structure goes.
2. Include file size and modification date in the output for each file to provide more context about the files in the directory.
3. Implement a way to customize the indentation characters for better visual representation based on user preference.
or
1. Implement depth control to limit the levels of subdirectories displayed for large trees.  
2. Add an option to include file sizes and modification dates for better context.  
3. Support customizable indentation and formatting styles for improved readability.  

get file language
1. Add an optional parameter to control the depth of the directory traversal, allowing users to limit how deep the tree structure goes.
2. Include file size and modification date in the output for each file to provide more context about the files in the directory.
3. Implement a way to customize the indentation characters for better visual representation based on user preference.

log event
1. Implement error handling to gracefully manage OSError exceptions and provide user-friendly messages.
2. Add support for more file extensions to the extension_map for better language detection.
3. Include an option to customize the depth of the directory traversal for more control over the output.

save synopsis
1. Implement a more comprehensive mapping for additional file extensions to cover more programming languages and formats.  
2. Add error handling for invalid file paths to prevent crashes and provide user feedback.  
3. Optimize the case-insensitive matching by using a normalized version of the file path for better performance. 

get llm response
1. Implement logging for successful directory validation to provide feedback on successful operations.  
2. Use a context manager for file operations in `log_event` to ensure proper resource management and automatic closure of the file.  
3. Add unit tests for `handle_directory_error` and `log_event` to ensure reliability and catch potential issues early.  

process repo
1. Implement input validation for `directory_path` in `log_event` and `save_synopsis` to ensure it is a valid directory before proceeding with file operations.
2. Use logging instead of print statements for error handling and success messages to maintain a consistent logging mechanism and improve traceability.
3. Refactor the file size check in `get_llm_response` to a separate utility function to enhance code readability and reusability.

generate sysnopsis text
1. Implement logging instead of print statements for better error tracking and debugging.
2. Add a check for file readability before attempting to read the content to prevent unnecessary exceptions.
3. Consider returning a more detailed error message for OSError to help diagnose specific issues.
