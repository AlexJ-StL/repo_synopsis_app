I have included a directory tree and description of an application that I am building which is the first step in a much larger vision. I have run into an unexpected snag that I could use some help working through and then creating a new plan for getting the application finished. Since I have run into this situation I would like to take the opportunity to re-evaluate and make sure that this application is worth the time to complete. So, below is a description of the first application, which I am currently working on, and the larger plan ("Big Picture") that this application is part of. The order will be 1. the "Big Picture" plan 2. The application "first step" 3. directory tree 4. results from the debugging that I did tonight 5. my current list of "to do"

1. The Big Picture:
* Long term I envisioned creating a work (code, tool, MCP, analytical chemistry papers, ideas for projects, etc), relationships (contacts, birthdays, special occasions, contact's preferences, conversational analysis and recommendations, etc), personal finance (basic accounting insights, personal investing analysis and planning, standard of living recommendations, etc.), life maximization (diet, exercise, health analysis and recommendations, etc), mind & spirit (continued education, challenging my habits and preconceptions, increasing virtue, mindfulness, theology, philosophy, etc). Basically a unified relational knowledge graph semantic data store that is updated, maintained, and reranked continually so that I can then create a personal agent framework for me as an individual. I realize that this is a lot of work, but I feel like a lot of it is merely collecting the information that will go into the database, which is not really "work". It's simply time consuming. This does of course make a lot of assumptions of what will happen in the future, like what I will do for work, will I have access to compute and storage or will that become too expensive for me, will I even live to see that eventuality. In the end, man makes plans and God laughs. But I digress... Before we move on, what do you think of this goal? Do you believe that I could build something unique, noteably better, complete it before another application is created that would accomplish the same goal? I guess the question is one of opportunity cost. If it is highly likely that a sufficiently acceptable application, then I should do something else that would be a better use of my time. If you think it is likely to be useful, somewhat original, and, ultimately, marketable then I would like to dedicate myself to getting this application going. I need your complete honesty with this one because I am currently unemployed and need to work on something that can bring in some income.
* This fairly large database oriented personal assistant I think could be marketed to high performing professionals and those who carry a heavy burden of responsibilities to help them maximize their life, free up "opportunity capital" that can then go into furthering whatever their pursuits are. In asking myself how can I unlock some of the value that AI can theoretically bring to individual's lives, this is what I came up with. It has also occurred to me that this idea only gets better as AI gets better and the models improving doesn't threaten this application. Lastly, I think that this application, if I can get it built, would be marketable to companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. I believe this because it hits all those companies' niches such as cloud storage, a whole life (work, relational, financial, health, etc) product that once integrated would be tremendously sticky, requires multiplatform access to powerful reasoning capable AI (which could be achieved by developing application specific models for desktop, cloud, and mobile, but would be a lot of work), and many other reasons. I'm sure that you understand where my head is at. What is your honest assessment? Is this something that I can accomplish with the help of AI by myself? 

2. First step:
* In considering where to begin I figure I would start at organization and cataloging. So, I would like to build an application that accesses the contents of folders and attaches a 'markdown' file in the directory or another location (I don't have a preference at the moment) containing the following information:
2a. creates a directory tree. This could be done, for example, through command line 'directory_tree'.
2b. a brief summary of what the folder contains or, if it is a repo, what the application does. This summary is an overview of the directory and should be as brief as possible while giving either a human or an AI the general idea of what is in the folder.
2c. a rough estimate of the total tokens contained within the directory. This is in preparation for future chunking, training, and storage considerations. Since we are making the effort to assess the directories, it makes sense to at least get a rough idea of how big each folder is token wise.
* If you have anything that you think would be beneficial to add to this application, please feel free to let me know.

4. Debugging and Tests:
*Results
4a. src\streamlit_app\streamlit_app.py: 156 statements, 84 missed, 46% coverage. This is the main Streamlit application file, and it has very low test coverage. 84 out of 156 lines of code were not executed when the tests ran. This means significant portions of the Streamlit application are untested.
4b. src\test_app\test_app.py: 51 statements, 2 missed, 96% coverage. This is the test file itself. It has good coverage (96%), but the fact that it misses 2 statements might indicate areas where the tests could be improved.
4c. TOTAL: The overall summary: 207 executable statements across all files, 86 missed, and 58% overall coverage. This highlights that the project's overall code coverage is relatively low (58%).

5. Current "To Do":
5a. Need to write more tests for streamlit_app.py. These tests should cover different scenarios, user inputs, and edge cases within the Streamlit application.
5b. Improve test_app.py: Even though test_app.py has good coverage (96%), investigate the two missed statements. Are they error handling conditions? Are they branches of code that are not being triggered by the current tests? Write tests to cover these missing parts of the test application.
5c. Prioritize Testing Complex Logic: Focus testing efforts on the most complex and critical parts of the streamlit_app.py. Areas dealing with data processing, UI interactions, external API calls, or complex business logic are especially important to test.
5d. Use Mocking (if necessary): Consider using mocking libraries (like unittest.mock) to isolate the application during testing. In order to test the application's logic without relying on the availability of those external resources.
5e. Test-Driven Development (TDD): Implement a TDD approach for future development in general starting with this application. Write the tests before I write the code. This forces me to think about the desired behavior of the code and ensures that it is testable from the beginning.
5f. In summary, the output shows that the selected tests passed, but the code coverage is low, particularly in the streamlit_app.py file. I need to write more tests to adequately test the Streamlit application. Prioritize writing tests for the core logic and areas with the highest risk of errors.
